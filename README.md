3d models for Alexa bracket

These models were created using IceSL.

Per the IceSL license, the only allowed use is for research, so I am researching how to create iterlocking 3D parts if anyone asks.

IceSL contains its own slicer. I would recommend opening the .lua file in Ice Forge and then directly exporting gcode for your 3D printer.

At the very bottom of the .lua file there are places where you can comment out either the top or the base to get the one you want using IceSL.

IceSL can also do an STL export, which I ran, but I have not verified the outputs.
